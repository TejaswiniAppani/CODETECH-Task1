Overview of the Project

Project: To-Do List Web Application

Objective
This To-Do List web application was developed during my internship at CodeTech Solutions.

Users can effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring efficient organization of their to-dos.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually or in bulk with a single click.

Technologies Used

CSS: Styles the application with a clean and modern design.
JavaScript: Implements the interactive functionalities, such as adding, editing, deleting, and saving tasks.


Development Details
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Local Storage: Utilizes browser's local storage to save tasks persistently, so they remain even after refreshing the page.


Usage
