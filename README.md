Overview of the Project

Project: To-Do List Web Application

Objective
This To-Do List web application was developed during my internship at CodeTech Solutions. The primary objective of this project is to streamline task management through a simple and intuitive user interface. Users can effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring efficient organization of their to-dos.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button.
Edit Tasks: Directly edit task names within the list for quick modifications.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually or in bulk with a single click.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure for the web application.
CSS: Styles the application with a clean and modern design.
JavaScript: Implements the interactive functionalities, such as adding, editing, deleting, and saving tasks.


Development Details
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Local Storage: Utilizes browser's local storage to save tasks persistently, so they remain even after refreshing the page.


Usage
Add a Task: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
Edit a Task: Click on the task name to enable editing. After making changes, click the "Save" button to update the task.
Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

Future Enhancements
Task Prioritization: Implement features to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Due Dates and Reminders: Enable users to set due dates and receive notifications for upcoming tasks.
Category Tags: Provide options to categorize tasks using tags for better organization.
Cloud Storage Integration: Sync tasks across devices using cloud storage solutions.
